# PH_Employee_Analysis

## Analysis Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to determine how many employees at Pewlett-Hackard are set to retire soon and require replacement as they are expecting a "silver tsunami". Using SQL, I determined the count of retiring employees by titles to determine how many replacements will be necessary for various positions. Furthermore, I retrieved all the senior (non-retiring) employees that would be eligible to be mentors for the replacements.

## Summary
Based on this analysis, Pewlett-Hackard has a tough issue on their hands in the coming years. There are over 90,000 employees set to retire and only 1,550 that are eligible for mentorship. That is a very small number of employees tasked with the assignment of mentoring over 90,000 replacements. In order to avoid challenges, Pewlett-Hackard should broaden the age range eligible for the mentorship program in order to increase the number of available mentors and ensure a smoother transition process for all the replacemnts.
