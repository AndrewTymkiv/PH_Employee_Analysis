# PH_Employee_Analysis

## Analysis Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to determine how many employees at Pewlett-Hackard are set to retire soon and require replacement as they are expecting a "silver tsunami". Using SQL, I determined the count of retiring employees by titles to determine how many replacements will be necessary for various positions. Furthermore, I retrieved all the senior (non-retiring) employees that would be eligible to be mentors for the replacements.
